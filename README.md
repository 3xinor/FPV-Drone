# FPV-Drone
FPV Drone software stack. Including the flight controller IMU unit, RF communications, computer vision application, and camera view interface application.

Project Goal: The goal of this project is to learn more about embedded real-time systems, flight mathematics/computation, computer vision, radio signal communication, electronics and machine learning. To do so I will research and develop a DIY FPV drone focusing on the firmware and applications to further advance my skills as a software engineer and have fun!
